# Lorenz Attractor Visualization

## Introduction
The Lorenz Attractor is a famous system of differential equations that exhibits chaotic behavior. Visualizing this system reveals a fascinating "butterfly" pattern, a hallmark of chaos theory.

This project demonstrates how to programmatically generate and animate the Lorenz Attractor using Python.

---

## Mathematical Background
The Lorenz system is defined by three differential equations:

```math
\frac{dx}{dt} = \sigma(y - x)
```
```math
\frac{dy}{dt} = x(\rho - z) - y
```
```math
\frac{dz}{dt} = xy - \beta z
```

Where:
- **x**, **y**, and **z** are system variables.
- **\( \sigma \)** (sigma) = 10 — Controls the speed of fluid motion.
- **\( \rho \)** (rho) = 28 — Controls chaotic behavior.
- **\( \beta \)** (beta) = 8/3 — Determines energy dissipation.

## Prerequisites
To run this visualization, you'll need:
- Python 3.x
- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `matplotlib`

You can install these libraries via pip:
```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
```

## Steps to Build the Visualization

### Step 1: Define the Lorenz System
- Create a function that computes the derivatives \( dx/dt \), \( dy/dt \), and \( dz/dt \).

### Step 2: Set Initial Conditions
- Choose initial values such as:
  - **x = 0.01**, **y = 1.0**, **z = 1.05**
- Define the simulation time and number of steps for smooth visualization.

### Step 3: Numerical Integration
- Use `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp()` to iteratively compute the system's evolution over time.

### Step 4: Visualizing the Attractor
- Use `matplotlib`'s 3D plotting capabilities to create a smooth path representing the Lorenz Attractor.
- Set axis limits and choose a suitable camera angle to showcase the "butterfly wings" shape.

### Step 5: Animation (Optional)
- Use `FuncAnimation` from `matplotlib` to dynamically reveal the attractor's evolution.

### Step 6: Customization and Enhancements
Consider adding:
- Color gradients to represent time progression.
- Multiple starting points to demonstrate the **butterfly effect**.
- Interactive controls for adjusting parameters in real-time.
